# Sagittarius: A RAG-Based Horoscope Chatbot

Sagittarius is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot designed to answer astrology-related questions using a curated horoscope dataset. By integrating LangChain, Pinecone, HuggingFace embeddings, and a local LLaMA model, it delivers concise, context-aware responses grounded in the provided data.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Features

- **RAG Architecture**  
  Combines document retrieval and generation for informed answers.

- **Semantic Search**  
  Uses HuggingFace embeddings + Pinecone to retrieve relevant horoscope snippets.

- **Re-Ranking**  
  Employs a CrossEncoder (MS-Marco MiniLM L6-v2) to prioritize the most pertinent chunks.

- **Local LLaMA Model**  
  Generates answers based solely on the retrieved context (no external API calls).
  **Llama 2-7B** for response generation (quantized version)

- **Astrology Focus**  
  Tailored to respond to user questions about horoscopes, star signs, and related topics.

Here are some of the replies of the rag.

I added different information about Zodiac some include the movie and some about the stars to see if it will get both documents correctly.

![good_reply_3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/32415336-3657-4da9-a698-b16501bc1c20)

I also made a threshold for the score at the re-ranking step so that documents with a score less than -2 doesn't pass to reduce hallucinations.

Some hallucinations still exist which implies that maybe a better llm architecture is required.
