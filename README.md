# Sagittarius: A RAG-Based Horoscope Chatbot

Sagittarius is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot designed to answer astrology-related questions using a curated horoscope dataset. By integrating LangChain, Pinecone, HuggingFace embeddings, and a local LLaMA model, it delivers concise, context-aware responses grounded in the provided data.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Features

- **RAG Architecture**  
  Combines document retrieval and generation for informed answers.

- **Semantic Search**  
  Uses HuggingFace embeddings + Pinecone to retrieve relevant horoscope snippets.

- **Re-Ranking**  
  Employs a CrossEncoder (MS-Marco MiniLM L6-v2) to prioritize the most pertinent chunks.

- **Local LLaMA Model**  
  Generates answers based solely on the retrieved context (no external API calls).
  **Llama 2-7B** for response generation (quantized version)

- **Astrology Focus**  
  Tailored to respond to user questions about horoscopes, star signs, and related topics.

---

## ðŸ“¥ Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sagittarius.git
   cd sagittarius
